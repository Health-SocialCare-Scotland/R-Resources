# Data explorer
## What's in here?
This folder contains the code used to create the [Data explorer](http://www.isdscotland.org/tpp/data-explorer/) Shiny app for [ISD's Hospital Acute Care Activity publication](http://www.isdscotland.org/tpp/).

This app creates a dashboard to dig into different slices of the data: time, deprivation, age and sex, geography etc.

At the moment it only includes the three scripts used to create the app, but eventually it will include the code that carries out the formatting of the data for the app, and the rest of elements needed to be reproducible.
