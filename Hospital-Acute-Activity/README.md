# Hospital Acute Care Activity
## What's in here?
This folder contains the code used to create [ISD's Hospital Acute Care Activity publication](http://www.isdscotland.org/tpp/).

It will include the code used to extract, manipulate and visualize the data presented in each data release.

[Data explorer](http://www.isdscotland.org/tpp/data-explorer/) - R Shiny app that creates a dashboard to dig into different slices of the data.
