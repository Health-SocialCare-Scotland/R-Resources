### Using R in PHI: R Style Guide
As part of the Transforming Publishing Programme work we have put together an R style guide for analysts in order to ensure that our R code is readable, shareable and reusable. We consider this to be an evolving guide to how R code should be written within PHI. It is designed to allow enough flexibility for analysts working on different projects, while maintaining consistency across the organisation and ensuring that code can be easily shared.

### R Guidance for PHI
You can view the R Guidance for PHI document as an html at https://Health-SocialCare-Scotland.github.io/R-Resources/R_Guidance_for_PHI.html

The R markdown code is also available on this repository under R_Guidance_for_PHI.Rmd. This guidance is intended to be a live document and anyone is able to update it with new features that will be useful for analysts in PHI. If you want to update this document, please create your own branch from master and raise a pull request. If this document is updated then you will need to upload a new html file. Once the new file has been uploaded the url above will automatically update. 

To upload the new html file, you need to perform the following steps:

- Knit the .Rmd file to html output
- Upload the new html file with the name R_Guidance_for_PHI.html to your branch, this will overwrite the original file
- Once this has been merged into the master branch the url above will automatically update with any changes
