# R-HSC-Scotland

As part of the Transforming Publishing Programme work we have put together an R style guide for analysts in order to ensure that our R code is readable, shareable and reusable. We have developed this document with support from our critical friend, David McAllister, and the aspiration is that it will eventually be used by all staff across PHI, and shared with NRS and the SG.

We consider this to be an evolving guide to how R code should be written within PHI, so we would be very grateful for any feedback you have on it. We have already received some useful feedback regarding shortcuts for creating sections, a more recent version of Hadley Wickham’s style guide and the haven function for reading SPSS files – we are aware of the haven function but haven’t tested it yet so it would be really helpful to know if people regularly use this!
