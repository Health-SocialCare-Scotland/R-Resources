# Using R in PHI

As part of the Transforming Publishing Programme work we have put together an R style guide for analysts in order to ensure that our R code is readable, shareable and reusable. We consider this to be an evolving guide to how R code should be written within PHI. It is designed to allow enough flexibility for analysts working on different projects, while maintaining consistency across the organisation and ensuring that code can be easily shared.

Two example scripts written in the recommended style will be available shortly, one for data wrangling and one for data visualisation. Two additional scripts are currently available which can be used by analysts to produce run charts and XmR charts (both types of Statistical Process Control, or SPC, charts) in R.
