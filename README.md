### Using R in PHI: R Style Guide
As part of the Transforming Publishing Programme work we have put together an R style guide for analysts in order to ensure that our R code is readable, shareable and reusable. We consider this to be an evolving guide to how R code should be written within PHI. It is designed to allow enough flexibility for analysts working on different projects, while maintaining consistency across the organisation and ensuring that code can be easily shared.
